# User Experiance 
+ Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock is a game of choice, the player plays against the computer to see who will win. 
+ Keeping the game simple with the choices on the bottom and the the game board in the middle of the screen. 
+ Each player has their own score above and below their option.

## Bugs 
+ The score on the game screen does not always count up for the winning player as it should.
+ I would like to have implemented a high score reset function, best out 3 or 5.
+ There is a problem with the responsiveness at 320px with the player score overlapping the player choices section.
